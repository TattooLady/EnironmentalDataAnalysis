# EnironmentalDataAnalysis
Collection of R code for environmental data analysis from my graduate coursework at Columbia University.

Lab 1: is the most basic introduction to R syntax
Lab 3: Exploratory data analysis: identifying watershed stressors
Lab 4: Advanced exploratory analysis: hierarchical and K means cluster analysis
Lab 6: Principal component analysis: creating an environmental performance index
Both Lab 9 and Lab 11: use logistical regression to look at relationship between national disaster aid money and long term economic growth.
